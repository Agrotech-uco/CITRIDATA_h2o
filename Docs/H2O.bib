	abstract = {Rapid expansion of the world’s population has negatively impacted the environment, notably water quality. As a result, water-quality prediction has arisen as a hot issue during the last decade. Existing techniques fall short in terms of good accuracy. Furthermore, presently, the dataset available for analysis contains missing values; these missing values have a significant effect on the performance of the classifiers. An automated system for water-quality prediction that deals with the missing values efficiently and achieves good accuracy for water-quality prediction is proposed in this study. To handle the accuracy problem, this study makes use of the stacked ensemble H2O AutoML model; to handle the missing values, this study makes use of the KNN imputer. Moreover, the performance of the proposed system is compared to that of seven machine learning algorithms. Experiments are performed in two scenarios: removing missing values and using the KNN imputer. The contribution of each feature regarding prediction is explained using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Results reveal that the proposed stacked model outperforms other models with 97\% accuracy, 96\% precision, 99\% recall, and 98\% F1-score for water-quality prediction.},

	abstract = {More and more businesses have taken to adopting Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning methods for solving problems in the application domain. One such area is Anomaly detection. While research in recent years has yielded better accuracies, the main hurdle for businesses remains managing the high cost of resources required for their implementation. Traditional ML/Deep Learning techniques require expert knowledge, and thus presently rely on human efficiency. Automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a solution to the above scenario. In this paper, we evaluate the performances of traditional anomaly detection techniques used in time-series forecasting, namely, statistical and deep learning models, and compare their results in terms of efficiency and performance with AutoML. We use H2O driverless AI (H2o.ai automl documentation, http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html, accessed: 2020-06-10) as our platform for experiments on AutoML. All the experiments are performed on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark's streaming time-series dataset (Lavin A and Subutai A in 2015 IEEE 14th international conference on machine learning and applications (ICMLA), pp 38–44).},

	abstract = {Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has revolutionized the field of machine learning by automating complex and time-intensive tasks such as data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. This study explores the capabilities, limitations, and practical applications of six widely used AutoML tools: Auto-sklearn, TPOT, H2O.ai, Google Cloud AutoML, Microsoft Azure AutoML, and Amazon SageMaker Autopilot. By evaluating these tools across diverse datasets—spanning tabular data, time series, image classification, and text sentiment analysis—the research highlights their predictive performance, computational efficiency, scalability, and explainability. Proprietary tools demonstrated superior scalability and efficiency through cloud integration, while open-source platforms provided more interpretability and flexibility. However, challenges such as lack of transparency in advanced neural architecture search mechanisms and ethical considerations, including bias mitigation, remain prevalent. This study concludes that while AutoML tools significantly lower the barrier to entry for machine learning, ongoing advancements are required to balance performance, usability, and ethical standards, making AutoML an integral solution for real-world applications.},

The complex mathematics behind it, however, can be discouraging for a lot of users. This is where H2O comes in – it automates various repetitive steps, and this encapsulation helps developers focus on results rather than handling complexities. You\&\#39;ll begin by understanding how H2O\&\#39;s AutoML simplifies the implementation of ML by providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to train and use ML models. Next, you\&\#39;ll see how AutoML automates the entire process of training multiple models, optimizing their hyperparameters, as well as explaining their performance. As you advance, you\&\#39;ll find out how to leverage a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) and Model Object, Optimized (MOJO) to deploy your models to production. Throughout this book, you\&\#39;ll take a hands-on approach to implementation using H2O that\&\#39;ll enable you to set up your ML systems in no time. By the end of this H2O book, you\&\#39;ll be able to train and use your ML models using H2O AutoML, right from experimentation all the way to production without a single need to understand complex statistics or data science.What you will learnGet to grips with H2O AutoML and learn how to use itExplore the H2O Flow Web UIUnderstand how H2O AutoML trains the best models and automates hyperparameter optimizationFind out how H2O Explainability helps understand model performanceExplore H2O integration with scikit-learn, the Spring Framework, and Apache StormDiscover how to use H2O with Spark using H2O Sparkling WaterWho this book is forThis book is for engineers and data scientists who want to quickly adopt machine learning into their products without worrying about the internal intricacies of training ML models.
